# Salary Estimations for Data Science Jobs - Project Overview:

- Create a tool that estimates the salaries for data scientists (mean squared error of around 10,000 dollars) that can be used for salary negotiation.
- Used selenium to scrape data from Glassdoor
- Used Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso and Random Forest Regression techniques for my MLMs

## Packages and resources used:
**Python Version:**3.7

## Web Scraping:
I scraped Glassdoor for 1000 data scientist job postings. This resulted in a .csv with the following columns:
- Job title
- Salary Estimate
- Job Description
- Rating
- Company Name
- Location
- Headquarters location
- Size
- Founded
- Type of industry
- Sector
